## Introduction
A lot of games need to save data between multiple game runs, in a small scope this can be done with Unitys [```PlayerPrefs```](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html) system, if the scope rises tough this small and easily integrated Data Manager can help you create, manage and load data via. files on the system easily and permanently over multiple game sessions.

**Unity Data Manager implements the following methods consisting of a way to:**
- method (see [method](#method))

For each method there is a description on how to call it and how to use it correctly for your game in the given section.

## Installation
**Required Software:**
- [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) Ver. 2020.3.17f1

The Data Manager itself is version independent, as long as the [```JsonUtility```](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/ScriptReference/JsonUtility.html) object already exists. Additionally the example project can be opened with Unity itself or the newest release can be downloaded and exectued to test the functionality.

If you prefer the first method, you can simply install the shown Unity version and after installing it you can download the project and open it in Unity (see [Opening a Project in Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/Manual/GettingStartedOpeningProjects.html)). Then you can start the game with the play button to test the Data Managers functionality.

To simply use the Data Manager in your own project without downloading the Unity project get the two files in the **Example Project/Assets/Scritps/** called ```DataManager.CS``` and ```FileData.CS``` or alternatively get the file from the newest release (may not include the newest changes) and save them in your own project. Then create a new empty ```gameObject``` and attach the ```DataManager.CS``` script to it.

# Documentation
This documentation strives to explain how to start using the Data Manager in your project and explains how to call and how to use its publicly accesible methods correctly.

## Reference to Data Manager Script
To use the Data Manager to start playing sounds outside of itself you need to reference it. As the Data Manager is a [Singelton](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2155688/what-is-a-singleton-in-c) this can be done easily when we get the instance and save it as a private variable in the script that uses the Data Manager.

```csharp
private DataManager dm;

private const string saveFile = "save";

private void Start() {
    dm = DataManager.instance;
    // Calling Function in DataManager
    dm.CreateNewFile(saveFile);
}
```

Alternatively you can directly call the methods this is not advised tough, if it is executed multiple times or you're going to need the instance multiple times in the same file.

```csharp
private const string saveFile = "save";

private void Start() {
    // Calling Function in DataManager
    DataManager.CreateNewFile(saveFile);
}
```

## Public accesible methods
This section explains all public accesible methods, especially what they do, how to call them and when using them might be advantageous instead of other methods. We always assume DataManager instance has been already referenced in the script. If you haven't done that already see [Reference to Data Manager Script](#reference-to-data-manager-script).
